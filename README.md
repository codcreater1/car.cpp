Vehicle Simulation Program
Welcome to the Vehicle Simulation Program repository! This C++ project is designed to simulate various types of vehicles, including cars and motorcycles, with features like engine control, speed adjustments, and information display.

Features
Vehicle Class: The foundation of the program, the Vehicle class encapsulates common attributes and behaviors shared by all vehicles, such as speed, gear number, and engine status.
Car Class: Extends the Vehicle class to represent cars, implementing specific functionalities like speed limits and gear changes tailored to car behavior.
MotorCycle Class: Also derived from Vehicle, this class models motorcycles with their own speed limits and gear change logic.

Usage
Once the program is running, you'll be prompted to interact with the vehicle simulation through the console. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the engine, adjust speed, and display vehicle information. Have fun experimenting with different vehicles and observing their behavior!
